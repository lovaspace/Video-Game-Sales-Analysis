# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis
The project represents a full DS cycle: cleaning and preparing video game sales data (up to 2016) for the 'Streamchik' store. EDA was conducted, key success factors (platforms, genres, ratings) were identified, a user profile was created for NA, EU, and JP, and hypotheses were tested for planning the 2017 campaign.
